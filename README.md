# 1D Cratering Calculation

Use the file `run.py` to run many consecutive simulations for different impactor sizes as sepcified in the file `impactors.txt`.

## Building
1. Make the RICH code using SCons and ensure all env variables are configured.

2. Run SCons in the home directory for this project

3. Add the desired impactor sizes to the file `impactors.txt` and then run `run.py` to start the simulations.
