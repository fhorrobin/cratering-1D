# 1D Cratering Calculation using Huji-RICH CFD code

Use the `generate_impactors.py` file to generate the desired list of impactor sizes or manually enter them in the file `impactors.txt`. Then use `run.py` to run the simulation. The RICH library must be compiled and the appropriate paths set as outlined on the repository for the RICH code (https://github.com/bolverk/huji-rich/).
